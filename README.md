# Automatic Categorization of Questions

This repository is part of a project aimed at automatically categorizing questions using machine learning techniques. It focuses on preprocessing unstructured data to make it usable, representing high-dimensional data visually, and implementing feature extraction and dimension reduction techniques.

## Project Details
- **GitHub Repository**: [Project Repository](https://github.com/sdmwd/IML-Open-Classrooms/tree/main/P5%20-%20Cat%C3%A9gorisez%20automatiquement%20des%20questions)

## Competencies Evaluated

- **Preprocessing Unstructured Data**: Transforming raw data into a format that can be analyzed and used in machine learning models.

- **Graphical Representation of High-Dimensional Data**: Utilizing techniques like PCA or t-SNE to visualize data patterns and insights in fewer dimensions.

- **Implementing Feature Extraction Techniques for Unstructured Data**: Applying methods such as NLP, TF-IDF, or word embeddings to extract meaningful features from text data.

- **Implementing Dimension Reduction Techniques**: Using algorithms to reduce the number of random variables under consideration, by obtaining a set of principal variables.
